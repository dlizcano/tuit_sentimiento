Opinion mining  for Twitter
Opinion mining has attracted great interest in recent years. One of the most promising applications is the analysis of opinions in social networks. In a broad sense, opinion mining is the computational study of opinions, sentiments, and emotions expressed in texts.

This code adapts the package sentiment https://github.com/timjurka/sentiment for the Spanish language.
Sentiment is an R package with tools for sentiment analysis including naive Bayesian classifiers for positivity/negativity and emotion classification.

See my example in Spanish here: [http://dlizcano.github.io/2014/04/30/Opinion-Mining-Tweets.html](https://dlizcano.github.io/english/Opinion-Mining-Tweets/)
